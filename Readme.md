## ⚔️ Attack Types

| Attack | Description | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|
| ⚡ Brute Force | Repeated login attempts against Auth Server | Firewall rate-limiting |
| 💥 DDoS Flood | Volumetric SYN flood from botnet | Firewall + traffic shaping |
| 💉 SQL Injection | Malicious queries via web app to dump DB | IDS payload inspection |
| 👁 Man-in-the-Middle | ARP spoofing to intercept internal traffic | IDS duplicate MAC detection |
| 🕷 XSS | Script injection to steal session cookies | IDS signature matching |

---

## 🛡️ Defense Controls

- **Firewall** — blocks volumetric and rate-based attacks at the network perimeter
- **IDS/IPS** — inspects packet payloads and raises alerts on known attack signatures

Toggle each defense on/off to compare protected vs. unprotected outcomes in real time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Animated packets traveling across network topology
- 3 network zones: Internet, DMZ, Internal Network
- 7 nodes: Attacker ×3, Web Server, Load Balancer, IDS/IPS, Core Router, DB, Auth, Admin PC
- Real-time event log with timestamps
- Live stats: blocked / detected / breached / packets
- Toggle firewall and IDS independently
- Zero dependencies — single HTML file, works offline
